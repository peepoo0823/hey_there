# hey_there

I am creating a database of leetcode questions, I will pay you to make leetcode questions. You will make questions and optionally solve them. I will pay you per question. You can solve as many as you want there is no limit.
you can make 10 today, 0 tomorrow, 3 the next day and 50 the next day.
The idea is to come up with a question that is hard, whose solutin does not exist in the internet and LLM cannot solve that question.

#### Questions:
- The question should **NOT** be easy to solve, and should **NOT** be copied from the internet.
- The question should be hard enough that LLM cannot solve it.
- The question shuold not be copied from somewhere or generated form LLM,**we will chec**k
- The question should have proper instruction of input,output and constrains, with a function signature with types
- Should have a solution of 20 lines minimum.
- The questions shuold be in md, you can use bold/italics/anything.... anything that markdown offers
- The Questions should not contain image/link
- If you are just making the question and not solving it, DOUBLE CHECK the asserts.
- The characters/story refered should be fictional

#### Answers: If you are solving the question as well
- Add a python file with the same name as above if solution is included
- Should have a doc string for the function
- Good comments
- Should not use any external library, python libraries are fine

#### Tips for coming up with questions
- Browse through leetcode, and find something you like, add a twist of your own, or something you found in the previous question.
- Wrap every question aroun an interesting story.
